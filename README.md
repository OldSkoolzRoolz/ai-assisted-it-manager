## AI Assisted Policy Manager + IT Companion
Enterprise level AI assisted policy and system monitor
🛡 Roadmap: Enterprise Policy Manager + AI‑Assisted IT Companion
Combines a custom ADMX/Group Policy toolkit with an AI intelligence layer for monitoring, automating, and self‑healing IT environments.

> [!IMPORTANT]
***This project is intended to be a pay-per-license software package after Phase 1.
 Phase 1 will be a single machine teaser release. I am looking for contributors
 of all skill levels. Those who stick it out with me will be offered paid positions
 for the release of the paid version. Great opportunity to learn and grow.***



Phase 1 — Foundation & Core Policy Manager
🎯 Goal: Build the baseline policy editor/manager with strong admin tools.
- Requirements Gathering
- Identify must‑support OS versions (Windows 10/11, Server variants).
- Define target environment scale (SMB vs. enterprise).
- Collect most‑requested policy controls (Defender, USB control, firewall rules).
- Core Features
- ADMX & ADML parser and visual editor.
- Real‑time validation and syntax highlighting.
- Live policy deployment to OU / local machine.
- Policy rollback & version history.
- Tech Stack
- Frontend/UI: WinUI 3 for modern desktop look + fluent controls.
- Backend/Core: C# .NET 8 for policy parsing, registry, and WMI integration.
- Storage: SQLite or lightweight embedded DB for versioning.

Phase 2 — AI‑Assisted Monitoring Layer
🎯 Goal: Add AI capabilities for recommendations, anomaly detection, and auto‑fixes.
- Data Collection
- Pull system config snapshots at intervals.
- Record applied policies vs. actual system state.
- Log deviations, errors, and change patterns.
- AI Integration
- Use lightweight ML models (ONNX in .NET) for:
- Pattern recognition (e.g., recurring misconfigurations).
- Predictive alerts (“Based on recent activity, this GPO may cause a service outage”).
- Natural language query engine (“Show me all devices where Defender was disabled in the last week”).
- Automation Hooks
- Pre‑approved “self‑healing” scripts to remediate violations.
- Suggest optimized policy configurations based on usage patterns.

Phase 3 — Enterprise Dashboard & Remote Control
🎯 Goal: Expand into centralized multi‑endpoint management.
- Features
- Web dashboard (Blazor Server) for remote monitoring & control.
- Role‑based access (admins, auditors, help desk).
- Real‑time push notifications to Teams/Slack.
- Audit reports for compliance (e.g., ISO, NIST, CIS).
- Security
- Encrypted communication (TLS 1.3).
- Signed policy packages to prevent tampering.

Phase 4 — Market & Monetization
🎯 Goal: Position as a niche but must‑have IT toolkit.
- Potential Models
- Free local‑only edition → Paid cloud‑connected edition.
- Per‑device monthly subscription for enterprise.
- White‑label version for MSPs.
- Go‑to‑Market Strategy
- Offer a Policy Advisor AI free trial.
- Build tutorials on “How to tame Group Policy chaos” — pull admins in via pain points.
- Partner with IT security blogs & YouTube channels.
