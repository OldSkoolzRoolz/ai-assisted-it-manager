## Splash Screen: Retro Code Loading Animation
The splash screen of the application is a retro-style code loading animation that adds a nostalgic touch to the user experience. It is an animation that mimics the look and feel of old-school computer loading screens, complete with pixelated graphics and a classic color scheme.
### Features:
- **Pixelated Graphics:** The splash screen features pixel art graphics that harken back to the early days of computing.
- **Classic Color Scheme:** A limited color palette is used to create a retro aesthetic.
- **Loading Animation:** The animation simulates a loading process, complete with progress indicators.
- **Keyboard activation**: Users can use the keyboard shortcut `need to investigate` to activate the splash screen at any time.
