# 🛡️ Self-Healing Policy Engine  Concept
**Empowering users with contextual control, auditability, and automation**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This engine exists to restore **user autonomy** in environments where system policies are rigid, opaque, or misaligned with actual user roles. It’s built for developers, IT managers, and power users who need **predictable, enforceable, and reversible policy logic** — without vendor-imposed friction.

> “Security should be role-aware. Lockdowns belong in parental controls and enterprise GPOs — not hardwired into personal machines.”

## 🔍 Core Capabilities

| Feature                  | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Policy Monitoring**     | Detects drift from expected system state (registry, Defender, firewall, etc.) |
| **Auto-Remediation**      | Reapplies desired settings when drift is detected                           |
| **Audit Logging**         | Tracks every change with timestamp, source, and outcome                     |
| **Role-Aware Enforcement**| Honors user-defined trust levels (e.g., dev, admin, guest)                   |
| **Modular Policy Packs**  | Repo-aware, versioned, and override-friendly                                |
| **Optional AI Advisory**  | Explains violations, suggests hardening, flags edge cases                   |

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

### 1. **Policy Definition Layer**
- YAML/JSON/PowerShell-based
- Example: `policies\Defender.yml`
- Supports overrides, dry-run mode, and role tagging

### 2. **Monitoring Engine**
- Registry watchers, WMI queries, Defender status checks
- Windows service or scheduled task
- Lightweight, modular, and scriptable

### 3. **Remediation Engine**
- Executes corrective actions
- Honors role-based exemptions (e.g., dev override vs. guest lockdown)
- Can escalate to advisory mode for ambiguous cases

### 4. **Audit + Logging**
- Local JSON logs, Event Viewer entries, or centralized dashboard
- Tracks policy name, action taken, user context, and result

### 5. **Role-Aware Logic**
- Policies tagged by trust level: `dev`, `admin`, `guest`, `child`, `enterprise`
- Enforcement adapts based on user profile or machine context

## 🧪 Example: Defender Policy (Role-Aware)

```yaml
policy: DefenderStatus
target: HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows Defender
expected:
  DisableAntiSpyware: 0
  DisableRealtimeMonitoring: 0
roles:
  guest: enforce
  dev: allow override
  child: enforce + alert
remediation:
  - Set-ItemProperty -Path $target -Name DisableAntiSpyware -Value 0
  - Set-ItemProperty -Path $target -Name DisableRealtimeMonitoring -Value 0
```

## 🔐 Philosophy

- **Security should be contextual** — not absolute
- **Autonomy should scale with trust** — devs and IT managers deserve control
- **Auditability is non-negotiable** — every change must be traceable
- **Remediation should be reversible** — no silent lockdowns
