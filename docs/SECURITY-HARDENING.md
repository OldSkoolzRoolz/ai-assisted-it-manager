# Security Hardening Guide

This document provides comprehensive guidance for implementing repository security features and branch protection settings for the ai-assisted-it-manager repository.

## Repository Security Features

### Branch Protection Rules

The following branch protection settings should be configured via GitHub Settings → Branches:

#### Master Branch Protection

**Required Settings:**
- ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
  - Required approving reviews: **2** (or 1 for fast iteration during early development)
  - Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
  - Require review from code owners (CODEOWNERS enforcement)
- ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
  - Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - Required status checks:
    - `build-and-test` (from dotnet-ci workflow)
    - `analyze` (from CodeQL workflow)
- ✅ **Require conversation resolution before merging**
- ✅ **Require linear history** (optional - see trade-offs below)
- ✅ **Include administrators** (enforce rules for repository administrators)
- ✅ **Restrict pushes that create files** (prevent direct pushes)
- ✅ **Restrict force pushes** (prevent history rewriting)
- ✅ **Restrict deletions** (prevent branch deletion)

#### Feature Branch Protection

For `feature/*` branches:
- ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
  - Required approving reviews: **1** (for faster development iteration)
  - Require review from code owners
- ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
  - Required status checks: `build-and-test`, `analyze`
- ✅ **Require conversation resolution before merging**

#### Release Branch Protection (Future)

When implementing release branches (`release/*` pattern):
- ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
  - Required approving reviews: **2**
  - Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
  - Require review from code owners
- ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- ✅ **Require conversation resolution before merging**
- ✅ **Include administrators**
- ✅ **Restrict force pushes and deletions**

### Trade-offs and Considerations

#### Linear History
**Pros:**
- Cleaner, more readable commit history
- Easier to understand project evolution
- Simplified debugging and bisecting

**Cons:**
- Requires rebasing instead of merge commits
- Can be confusing for developers unfamiliar with rebasing
- May complicate conflict resolution

**Recommendation:** Enable for mature projects, consider disabling during early rapid development.

#### Signed Commits (Optional)
**Pros:**
- Cryptographic verification of commit authorship
- Enhanced security for critical repositories
- Compliance with enterprise security requirements

**Cons:**
- Additional setup complexity for contributors
- Potential barrier to contribution
- GPG key management overhead

**Recommendation:** Consider enabling for production releases and security-critical changes.

## Security Scanning and Monitoring

### Secret Scanning

Enable via GitHub Settings → Security & analysis:
- ✅ **Secret scanning** - Detect secrets committed to repository
- ✅ **Secret scanning push protection** - Prevent secrets from being committed
- ✅ **Secret scanning validity checks** - Verify if detected secrets are active

### Dependabot Security Updates

Configure via GitHub Settings → Security & analysis:
- ✅ **Dependabot alerts** - Get notified of vulnerable dependencies
- ✅ **Dependabot security updates** - Automatic PRs for security vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Dependabot version updates** - Managed by dependabot.yml configuration

### Code Scanning

Enable via GitHub Settings → Security & analysis:
- ✅ **Code scanning** - Automated security analysis with CodeQL
- ✅ **Default setup** - Use CodeQL workflow for C# analysis
- ✅ **Required checks** - Include CodeQL in branch protection rules

## Workflow Security

### GitHub Actions Security

**Permissions:**
- Use minimal required permissions for each workflow
- Prefer `contents: read` and specific permissions as needed
- Avoid `actions: write` unless absolutely necessary

**Secrets Management:**
- Store sensitive data in GitHub Secrets
- Use environment-specific secrets when appropriate
- Regularly rotate secrets and API keys

**Third-party Actions:**
- Pin actions to specific SHA or version tags
- Regularly update action versions via Dependabot
- Review action source code for security implications

## Repository Security Settings

### General Security Settings

Configure via GitHub Settings → General:
- ✅ **Private vulnerability reporting** - Enable security advisory reporting
- ✅ **Discussions** - Consider enabling for community engagement (optional)

### Access Control

Configure via GitHub Settings → Manage access:
- **Repository owners:** @KyleC69, @OldSkoolzRoolz
- **Collaborator permissions:** Minimum required permissions
- **Base permissions:** Read (prevent accidental access escalation)

### Webhook Security

If using webhooks:
- ✅ Use webhook secrets for payload verification
- ✅ Restrict webhook URLs to trusted endpoints
- ✅ Monitor webhook delivery logs

## Compliance and Auditing

### Audit Logging

- ✅ **Organization audit log** - Track repository access and changes
- ✅ **Repository activity** - Monitor pull requests, issues, and commits
- ✅ **Security alerts** - Review and respond to security notifications

### Documentation Requirements

Per [DOCUMENTATION_VERSION_MANIFEST.md](../docs/DOCUMENTATION_VERSION_MANIFEST.md):
- ✅ Update documentation version manifest for security-related changes
- ✅ Tag @KyleC69 for approval on security documentation updates
- ✅ Include technical accuracy reviews for security configurations

## Implementation Checklist

### Immediate Actions (Repository Administrators)

- [ ] Configure master branch protection rules
- [ ] Enable secret scanning and push protection
- [ ] Enable Dependabot alerts and security updates
- [ ] Enable CodeQL code scanning
- [ ] Configure required status checks for CI workflows
- [ ] Enable CODEOWNERS enforcement
- [ ] Set up webhook security (if applicable)

### Ongoing Maintenance

- [ ] **Weekly:** Review Dependabot alerts and security updates
- [ ] **Monthly:** Audit repository access and permissions
- [ ] **Quarterly:** Review and update security configurations
- [ ] **Annually:** Comprehensive security audit and documentation review

### Development Team Responsibilities

- [ ] Follow pull request template requirements
- [ ] Respect CODEOWNERS approval requirements
- [ ] Participate in security review discussions
- [ ] Report security vulnerabilities per [SECURITY.md](../.github/SECURITY.md)
- [ ] Keep development environments secure and up-to-date

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Security Notifications

Configure notifications for:
- ✅ Security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- ✅ Secret scanning alerts
- ✅ Failed security checks in CI/CD
- ✅ Unusual repository access patterns

### Integration with IT Infrastructure

For enterprise deployments:
- Consider integration with SIEM systems
- Set up alerting to security teams
- Implement automated response procedures
- Maintain incident response documentation
